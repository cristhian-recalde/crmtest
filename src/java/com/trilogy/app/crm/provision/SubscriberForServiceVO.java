 * 
 * This class is used to hold the newsubscriber, oldsubscriber values. Purpose: Uptill
 * CRM6 all the servcies were having similar logic for provisoning and unprovisioning and
 * depending upon the state/msisdn changes either ProvisionAgent or UnprovisionAgent was
 * getting called. The problem here is for any new service which doesnt want to obey
 * current behavior of the services we dont get correct newSubscriber and oldSubscriber
 * objects correctly in the context (because SubscriberProvisionServicesHome puts old
 * subscriber in the ocntext upon some conditions. This object will hold the correct
 * values and any new service agant like VoicemailProvisionAgent can use this object in
 * order to deviate from all the other services' behavior.
 * 
 * We should later redesign SubscriberProvisionServicesHome such that there is no need to
 * create and put this object in the context.
